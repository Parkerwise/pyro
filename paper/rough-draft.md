(Why this instrument sucks)
- Introduction
    - talk about the sun and the history of its measurement
        - [ ] stefan-boltzman law
        - [ ] TSI measurement 
        - [ ] absolute cavity radiometer
        - [ ] Define black body
    - specifically talk about wiens law and how SED have been used to measure it
    - talk about radiative transfer wrt all this
    - how does optical pyrometry work?
        - discuss the issue with field of view
- Methods
    - [x] make apparatus figure
    - discuss apparatus
    - talk about how we took measurements, talk about time, mention number
- Results
    - make plot based off of data
    - from data find S lambda, find optical depth, find temperature of the sun
    - discuss your findings
    - discuss uncertainty
- Conclusions
    - shit sucks 
    - compare to temp of the sun right now
    - talk about the FOV issue
- Abstract
    - we measure this with this uncertainty and it sucked
