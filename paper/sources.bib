	abstract = {In this brief communication we provide the rationale forand the outcome of the International Astronomical Union ({IAU}) resolution vote at the {XXIXth} General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants between solar and planetary values and {SI} units: a missing standard has caused a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar luminosity, solar effective temperature, and solar mass parameter) in the literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an {IAU} Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in 2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary, and fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standardsﬁelds to converge on optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the {IAU} 2015 Resolution B3, passed at the {IAU} General Assembly by a large majority. The resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are by deﬁnition exact and are expressed in {SI} units. These nominal values should be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work and publications to help minimize further confusion.},

The 1367 W/m2 average solar ‘constant’ result is uncertain by less than ±0.5\%, the most accurate determination to date. Nearly simultaneous observations by the Nimbus 6 earth radiation budget total irradiance detector of 1389 W/m2 exceeded the rocket result by 1.6\%. These recent results are discussed in the context of a summary of solar constant determinations made above the troposphere by cavity pyrheliometers.},
