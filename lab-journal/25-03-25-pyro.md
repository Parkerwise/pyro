# Intentions
---
Today we would *like* to get data, but our main goal is to calibrate the instrument.

# Measurements
---
No direct measurement were taken

# Summary
---
We started by "playing" with the scope and getting a feel for how the instrument works.
1. spot source w/o filter
2. put on the filter
3. adjust the temp scale to match the manual
4. press the button, take a measurement of the amps.

We now have an understanding of the instrument and how to use it to get temperature readings. We kinda just had to fiddle with it but it works now I suppose
