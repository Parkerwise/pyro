# Intentions
---
Today we plan to take calibrating data, and then once that is over we will try to get data for the temperature of the sun.

# Measurements
---
We measured 21 and 22 on the bottom scale of the pyrometer, but I am uncertaian as to how well we took those measurements.

# Summary
---
We did some final investigation today on how the instrument works (largely figuring out the temperature scale). It appears that their might not be any calibration that we can do other than calibrating the internal lamp, which feels out of the scope of this project, and if we decide to do it, we can do it after the first draft is turned in. We plan to come in saturday and get data.
