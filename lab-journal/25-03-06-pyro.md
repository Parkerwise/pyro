# Intentions
---
My lab partner is Dayne L. Today we are spending our time in lab figuring out the theory of the pyrometry experiment, and what data we will be collecting.

# Measurements
---
We did not collect any data.

# Summary
---
The equation for the observed flux of an object is,
${\displaystyle j^{\star }=\varepsilon \sigma T^{4}.}$

We can calculate the flux given an intensity (what we will be measuring), and from the distance to the sun (a known value). When we return to lab, we will be calibrating the instrument, and when we finish that, we will start to take data for the temperature of the Sun.
